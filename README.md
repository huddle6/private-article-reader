`Private Article Reader` is a Next.JS app that scrapes, parses the article and shows it in a standard easy-to-understand manner. It removes all JavaScript from the original page, including but not limited to trackers and other elements such as inputs and buttons. 🚀

It is aimed to provide a simple distraction-free way to read and enjoy articles. 📚🍃
